// ABOUT THIS PLUGIN
//============================================
// Chat-Processor Tags was created by 404 (abrandnewday on AlliedMods)
//Chat-Processor Tags started life as a copy of Custom Chat Colors by Dr. McKay (http://www.doctormckay.com)
// 
// Chat-Processor was created by Keith Warren (Drixevel) (redwerewolf on AlliedMods)
// 
// Chat-Processor started life as a copy of Simple Chat Colors (Redux) by minimoney1
// that had been updated to new 1.8 syntax by 404 (abrandnewday on AlliedMods)
//	
// The configuration is very similar, so I've stolen and modified Dr. McKay's documentation :P
//============================================
// CONVERTING CUSTOM-CHATCOLORS.CFG ENTRIES
//============================================
// If you want to use multiple colors in a tag
//===========================================
// 1. Copy the contents of your original custom-chatcolors.cfg file and paste them into chat-processor-tags.cfg
// 2. Change "admin_colors" at top of the entries to "chat_processor_tags"
// 3. Edit the "tag" line for each of your config entries and add the proper color codes to that line
// 4. You can remove the "tagcolor" bits if you want. Leaving them in won't hurt anything. The plugin now detects if there's color codes in the tag string, and if there are, it'll use those colors instead of the "tagcolor" color.
//
// You can also use any hex color code you want to in the "tag" simply by putting it inside brackets, like this:
// #FFC000 would be changed to {#FFC000}
//
// For example:
//
// "tag" "{#FFC000}[{community}ADMIN{#FFC000}] "
// ===========================================
// If you don't
// ===========================================
// 1. Copy the contents of your original custom-chatcolors.cfg file and paste them into chat-processor-tags.cfg
// 2. Change "admin_colors" at top of the entries to "chat_processor_tags"
// 3. You're done. You don't have to change anything else. Everything should work as normal.
//============================================
//	READ ME IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS ON CS:GO
//============================================
//	
//	For CS:GO, you will need to format your entries a little differently:
//	
//	"STEAM_0:1:1234567"					<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//	{
//		"tag"			"[ADMIN] "		<--	This is the text for the tag. Do not add any colors into this field.
//		"tagcolor"		"G"				<--	This is the color for the tag. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//		"namecolor"		"T"				<--	This is the color for the name. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//		"textcolor"		"O"				<--	This is the color of the text. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//	}
//	
// Yes, I know, CS:GO really sucks for chat color support right now. Deal with it.
// And FYI, I was originally planning on adding in an APLRes check to prevent this plugin from running on CS:GO.
// However I would've had to deal with hordes of people asking/demanding for CS:GO support, so this was the next best solution.
//============================================
// ORDER OF OPERATIONS
//============================================
// The order in which you place items in the config file matters.  Here is what determins what color they get:
// 1. SteamID
//    If there is a steamid present, it will always override everything.  If you put a steamid in twice
//    then the first entry (top to bottom) will be used. (I think, just don't do it!)
// 2. Groups
//    The plugin will search (top to bottom) for a postitive match for the flag string.  The player' flags
//    will be compared with the group flag character (NOTE: only one flag per group! "a" is okay, "ab" is NOT),
//    and if the player has the flag, it will stop there.
//    For example. Admins with the "ad" flags and donators with the "a" flag.  If you place the "a" flag group
//    above the "d" group then the admin will get the "a" colors. Order matters.
//============================================
// EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE SETUP
//============================================
// "chat_processor_tags"							<--	Leave this alone
// {												<--	Add all groups/steamids after first bracket (Leave this alone)
//    "STEAM_0:1:1234567"							<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//    {											<-- Open the steamid
//        "tag"			"{community}[ADMIN] "	<--	This is the text for the tag. Include color values for your tag here
//			"namecolor"		"#RRGGBB" 				<--	This is the color for the name (#RRGGBB in hex notation or #RRGGBBAA with alpha)
//			"textcolor"		"#RRGGBBAA"				<--	This is the color of the text
//    }											<-- Close the steamid
// 
//    "groupname"									<--	This can either be a steamid for a specific player, or a group name
//    {											<--	Open the group
//        "flag"			"z"						<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//        "tag"			"[ADMIN] "				<--	This is the text for the tag. Personal preference of mine is to add a space after the tag
//        "namecolor"		"G"						<--	This is the color for the name
//        "textcolor"		"T"						<--	This is the color of the text
//		}											<--	Close the group
//	}												<--	Add all groups/steamids before last bracket (Leave this alone)
//	
//	NOTES:
//		- If you don't enter a steamid then the group name does not matter, it's just for your reference.
//		- If you want to use multiple color strings in the "tag" field, go right ahead.
//			- Here's a perfect example for you to try. It results in a tag that says [HOT] and looks like it's a fireball:
//			  "tag"			"{red}[{orange}H{yellow}O{orange}T{red}] "
//          - Using a custom hex color not covered by ColorVariables? Try putting it inside brackets like so:
//            "tag"         "{red}[{#FFC000}TAG{red}] "
//		- If you want to use symbols and alt codes and unicode shit, try saving this cfg file in a different Unicode format.
//		- For a list of colors, download the "colorvariables.inc" file and view it in Notepad
//	
//	For name/text colors, either a hex notation of a color (#RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA) or a supported shortcut (O - Olive, G - Green, T - Team) are required
//============================================

"chat_processor_tags"
{
//	Example entry using 404's Steam ID (http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/404UNFGaming)
//	Note the usage of multiple color strings within the tag.
//	My personal preference is to add a space after the tag so there is a space between
//	the tag and the player name in chat. It looks much nicer that way.
//	"STEAM_0:1:28177988"
//	{
//		"tag"				"{valve}[{gold}PLUGIN DEV{valve}] "
//	}
}
