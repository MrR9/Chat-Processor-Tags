//============================================
//	ABOUT THIS PLUGIN
//============================================
//	Chat-Processor Tags was created by 404 (abrandnewday on AlliedMods)
//	
//	Chat-Processor Tags started life as a copy of
//	Custom Chat Colors by Dr. McKay (http://www.doctormckay.com)
//	
//	Chat-Processor was created by Keith Warren (Drixevel) (redwerewolf on AlliedMods)
//	Chat-Processor started life as a copy of Simple Chat Colors (Redux) by minimoney1
//	that had been updated to new 1.8 syntax by 404
//	
//	The configuration is very similar, so I've stolen and modified Dr. McKay's documentation :P
//============================================
//	CONVERTING CUSTOM-CHATCOLORS.CFG ENTRIES
//============================================
//	Simply copy your the entries over to this config file. The easiest way to do this is to change the "admin_colors" bit at the top of
//	custom-chatcolors.cfg to "chat_processor_tags". Then copy the entirety of the now-named "chat_processor_tags" code into this file.
//	
//	From there, you can modify the tags as you see fit. For the most part you can just leave everything alone in the config file.
//	
//	If you want to make your tags have multiple colors, then you can remove the "tagcolor" line from the specific tag entry
//	and add the proper coloring into the "tag" line.
//============================================
//	READ ME IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS ON CS:GO
//============================================
//	For CS:GO, you will need to format your entries a little differently:
//	
//	"STEAM_0:1:1234567"					<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//	{
//		"tag"			"[ADMIN] "		<--	This is the text for the tag. Do not add any colors into this field.
//		"tagcolor"		"G"				<--	This is the color for the tag. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//		"namecolor"		"T"				<--	This is the color for the name. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//		"textcolor"		"O"				<--	This is the color of the text. Choose from T (teamcolor), G (green), or O (olive)
//	}
//	
//	Yes, I know, CS:GO really sucks for chat color support right now. Deal with it.
//	And FYI, I was originally planning on adding in an APLRes check to prevent this plugin from running on CS:GO.
//	However I would've had to deal with hordes of people asking/demanding for CS:GO support, so this was the next best solution.
//============================================
//	ORDER OF OPERATIONS
//============================================
//	The order in which you place items in the config file matters.  Here is what determins what color they get:
//	1. SteamID
//		If there is a steamid present, it will always override everything.  If you put a steamid in twice
//		then the first entry (top to bottom) will be used. (I think, just don't do it!)
//	2. Groups
//		The plugin will search (top to bottom) for a postitive match for the flag string.  The player' flags
//		will be compared with the group flag character (NOTE: only one flag per group! "a" is okay, "ab" is NOT),
//		and if the player has the flag, it will stop there.
//		For example. Admins with the "ad" flags and donators with the "a" flag.  If you place the "a" flag group
//		above the "d" group then the admin will get the "a" colors. Order matters.
//============================================
//	EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE SETUP
//============================================
//	"chat_processor_tags"							<--	Leave this alone
//	{												<--	Add all groups/steamids after first bracket (Leave this alone)
//		"STEAM_0:1:1234567"							<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//		{											<-- Open the steamid
//			"tag"			"{community}[ADMIN] "	<--	This is the text for the tag. Include color values for your tag here
//			"namecolor"		"#RRGGBB" 				<--	This is the color for the name (#RRGGBB in hex notation or #RRGGBBAA with alpha)
//			"textcolor"		"#RRGGBBAA"				<--	This is the color of the text
//		}											<-- Close the steamid
//		
//		"groupname"									<--	This can either be a steamid for a specific player, or a group name
//		{											<--	Open the group
//			"flag"			"z"						<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//			"tag"			"[ADMIN] "				<--	This is the text for the tag. Personal preference of mine is to add a space after the tag
//			"namecolor"		"G"						<--	This is the color for the name
//			"textcolor"		"T"						<--	This is the color of the text
//		}											<--	Close the group
//	}												<--	Add all groups/steamids before last bracket (Leave this alone)
//	
//	NOTES:
//		- If you don't enter a steamid then the group name does not matter, it's just for your reference.
//		- If you want to use multiple color strings in the "tag" field, go right ahead.
//			- Here's a perfect example for you to try. It results in a tag that says [HOT] and looks like it's a fireball:
//			  "tag"			"{red}[{orange}H{yellow}O{orange}T{red}] "
//		- If you want to use symbols and alt codes and unicode shit, try saving this cfg file in a different Unicode format.
//		- For a list of colors, download the "colorvariables.inc" file and view it in Notepad
//	
//	For name/text colors, either a hex notation of a color (#RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA) or a supported shortcut (O - Olive, G - Green, T - Team) are required
//============================================

"chat_processor_tags"
{
//	Example entry using 404's Steam ID (http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/404UNFGaming)
//	Note the usage of multiple color strings within the tag.
//	My personal preference is to add a space after the tag so there is a space between
//	the tag and the player name in chat. It looks much nicer that way.
//	"STEAM_0:1:28177988"
//	{
//		"tag"				"{valve}[{gold}PLUGIN DEV{valve}] "
//	}
}
